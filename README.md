# Centered Gradient Button with Hover Effect

This project features a **modern button design** that is centered on the page with a **gradient background** and **smooth hover effects**.

## **Features**
- **Full-Page Centering**:  
  - Uses `display: flex`, `justify-content: center`, and `align-items: center` to ensure the button is perfectly centered on the screen.
  
- **Stylish Button Design**:  
  - A **gradient background** transitioning from `#ff0066` (pinkish-red) to `#ff6600` (orange).
  - **Rounded corners** (`border-radius: 50px`) for a modern look.
  - **White text color** for high contrast and better readability.

- **Hover Effects**:  
  - **Glow effect** with increased `box-shadow` for a visually appealing hover state.
  - **Subtle movement** (`transform: translateY(-3px)`) to enhance interactivity.
